# About

Unfold is a mental heath app that helps people overcome the lack of communication during and after the pandemic. "Unfold" aims to provide a healing community for expressing feelings safely. You will encounter friends through anonymous letters and embrace every unique person with a sincere heart.


## Why different compare to the traditional therapy?
Compared to traditional 1-to-1 therapy, emotions in Unfold are shared in the community. An artificial intelligence-based recommendation system is used in our application. It selects three different letters from other users that sent out each day. These letters can be short story, emotional quotes, or a personal experience. From reading the letters, our user might smile, laugh, or even have a drop of tears. Emotion will resonance long after the reading, and this provides an emotional catharsis for our users.
